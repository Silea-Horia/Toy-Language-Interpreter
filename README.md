!!!WIP!!!

During the Advanced Programming Methods course we had to implement an interpreter for our own toy language. 
So far, we had to implement types, expressions, statements, an execution stack, a symbol table etc. all using OOP concepts and a MVC design pattern. 
Later on I'll introduce a garbage collector/heap manager, multi-threading support and a GUI.
